# MATLAB_course
This course is about MATLAB application in linear control systems.
In 2021, I turned my studies in the field of MATLAB applications in the course of linear control systems into an educational video and published them for free on this date(14 April 2022), in this repository. and I hope it's useful for all students that need them.
